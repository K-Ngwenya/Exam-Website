                Critical Reflection
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                For this exam I am required to submit a deployed portfolio website with good 
                UI/UX and appropriate design and typography. It is also required to run on code 
                with zero plagiarism. In this critical reflection I will be going over the sight 
                and determining to what extent these requirements have been met. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                UI/UX
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My home page user interface allows the user to initially navigate to anything and 
                everything they may need in one click. I have achieved this through what I like to 
                call an “Open-Plan” home page. An open plan room is one in which there are little 
                to no walls dividing it up into smaller sections. In a similar vein, on my home page, 
                there is nothing keeping the user from any part of the website. The user can access 
                all blog posts and pieces of information on that single page. I believe this is great 
                because the user does not have to complete many actions to find what they came for. 
                The drawback to this layout, however, is that it potentially increases the amount of 
                time it takes the user to make a decision. Hick’s law states that “The time it takes 
                to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.” My home page 
                gives the user a lot of choices to make at once, which means that if they did not come 
                to the sight with a specific piece of information in mind it may take them longer to 
                decide what they would like to see first. I am willing to tolerate this drawback because 
                I believe it is frustrating to have to wade through a series of lists and options. The user 
                may take a moment longer to decide where they want to go, but once they do decide they will 
                have a relatively easy time getting there. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                On my content pages we see a scroll-bar system like the one on the home screen. This list of 
                items contains articles that are similar or contain the same type of information as the information 
                the user is currently looking at. So, for example, if you are looking at a blog post the scrollable 
                items at the bottom of the page are a collection of other blog posts. This was inspired by the many 
                social media platforms have algorithms that will show you more of what you like. Since I cannot create 
                an algorithm to track the user and then alter the site to show them more of what they like I have 
                decided to try and make that decision before hand by just grouping similar bits of information together. 
                This has the effect of again reducing the number of actions the user must take to find information they 
                would likely want to see. The drawback with this idea is that the user is not encouraged to explore the 
                rest of the site once they are in a specific section. They may decide that they are done reading through 
                blogs and then discover that there is much more that they could have seen. Or they could simply leave without 
                seeing the other things. The only thing I’m hoping will prevent this from happening is the “About Me” section 
                which is now on top (as suggested in the feedback I received). It is a short section and will definitely give 
                people time to see that there is more to the site. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I have decided not to include a nav bar. From the feedback from assignment 2 I saw that my nav bar included a 
                lot of unnecessary elements and adding the sections I already have to the nave bar would be redundant and require 
                me to create new menu pages. This seemed to me like it would be a waste of effort since my home page acts as a 
                kind of nav bar on its own.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The fonts used on my sight are all from the San Serif family. This family is known for having good readability. 
                My colour scheme now includes some red and black in the background (inspired by the Anime.js website) to add some 
                much-needed colour. These colours stay still on the home page so that all the fonts are always readable but move 
                around on pages that have still white backgrounds. My creative additions have not significantly compromised the 
                websites readability. I was initially worried about the moving background colours distracting the user from the 
                content they need to read but after slowing down the animation and giving the website to a few people to look at 
                I was able to conclude that the content is still readable with the moving background. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Technical
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                On the technical side of my website, things are looking better. I made sure to include many of the tags that are 
                essential for good semantic markup. The HTML is not perfect though as it contains some &lt;<div>&gt;s and is missing the 
                necessary &lt;<cite>&gt; and &lt;<figure>&gt; tags. Another issue is the JavaScript that is found in all my HTML pages. This 
                is there because I struggle to get the code to work in its own JavaScript file. I decided that since the code 
                snippet was quite small, and I needed the gradient provided by the Granim API to help make my website less plain, 
                that I would keep it in. All other JavaScript is stored in separate JavaScript files. This means the damage to the 
                neatness and quality of my code is minimal. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                One issue I had was giving my elements proper ids and classes. I often struggled to get CSS or JavaScript to communicate 
                with my HTML and would create a lot of test elements with random names. As a result, some elements have strange names and 
                there are bits of CSS that do not do anything. This increases file sizes and will make maintenance extremely difficult for 
                someone who has never seen my code before. Given more time I would definitely have to go back to every script and remove 
                unnecessary bits of code.    
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Through trying to learn JavaScript APIs and gain more knowledge on web development, I have realized that my code could be 
                a lot neater and simpler. I am not sure if it is possible to fix the code I currently have or if it all just needs to be 
                redone from scratch, but it can definitely be more developer friendly. None of it is blatantly plagiarized. It may have 
                similar structures to code found on tutorials and examples from API documentation, but none of it is just straight copy-paste.
