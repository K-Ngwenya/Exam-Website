                The Medium is the Message?
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                At first glance The Medium is the Message seems to be trying to teach us that 
                what we write/say in the media is inconsequential. I was quite happy to believe 
                that this was McLuhan’s message because with the scale of the media today in its 
                many forms (mostly TV and the internet), I can see how a single piece of content 
                can be seen as a drop of water in an ocean. Even the biggest news stories, whether 
                they are about war or a massive petrol price hike, are forgotten quite quickly. 
                This conclusion began to fall apart when I realised that the reading was written in 
                the 60s. A time when newspaper and radio were still the largest forms of media and TV 
                was only a little over 8 years old in Canada. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                It seems more like McLuhan was speaking on the power of the media themselves. As the 
                media change and grow, the way we interact with information changes and grows as well. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                For example: When radio and newspaper were the main sources of information it was a 
                little easier to trust the information you get. The newspaper came from a registered 
                company with a CEO, management, and a building somewhere. Writing false information 
                would have serious consequences for those people, so they were less likely to go buck
                wild printing lies on a weekly basis. The internet on the other hand, allows for any 
                person with an internet connection and an agenda to anonymously write garbage and post 
                it as news. Many of us are aware of this and will take the information with a grain of 
                salt. Some will even go as far as doing their own research to try and verify what they’re reading. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Changes like this can affect far more than just how we interact with information. As 
                the media grows to deliver more information faster or make information more easily 
                available, we will begin to see the world around us differently. Consumers may choose 
                their preferred products based on how these products are sourced (information which is 
                usually readily available on the right websites). Education is made easier with more 
                accessible information. Our pets may live longer because we don’t have to go to a vet 
                to learn that you can’t just feed your dog anything. All this information was out there 
                already for a long time. The media has just grown large enough to be able to deliver it 
                all at any given time, and fast enough for it to be available to a lot more people.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This change in how we view information is entirely due to changes in the medium. The 
                content itself has no effect on how we process it. It is to my understanding that McLuhan 
                is trying to highlight that if we focus on the content too much, we fail to notice the 
                effect of the medium on our lives.
