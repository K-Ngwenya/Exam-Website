                Analysis of my UI and UX.
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                A portfolio site is just there to provide the user with information. 
                Therefore, the ability to traverse the site and finding the information
                easily is what I want my site to provide. To do this, the navigation 
                will have to be well thought out and the UI needs to be neat and simple 
                as not to confuse the user.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I started by designing my UX as Peta suggested in her notes. First, 
                I thought about the information I was providing. It can be divided into 
                three categories: Blog posts, Design information, and information about me. 
                I believe that a user entering the portfolio site is either an employer, in 
                which case they would want to see the information about me (my bio, projects 
                I’ve worked on, my interests) or they are marking. If they are marking, they 
                might be more interested in my blog posts. By dividing this information into 
                sections, I save the user from having to swim through things they never wanted 
                to look at so they can get to what they want. I also offer the user fewer choices 
                to make at once, thus reducing the time it takes for the user to decide (Hick’s Law). 
                The user first chooses between the three sections (this is the first decision). Then 
                they choose between one of the pieces of information found within the sections. There 
                is a maximum of 6 of these pieces of information. Had I not divided the information, 
                the user would have to choose between 12 different pieces of information at one time.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Once the user selects a piece of information, they are taken to a screen where they 
                will first find the article they have chosen in the centre of the screen. At the bottom 
                of the screen, the user sees a collection of large buttons that they can use to navigate 
                through information of the same section. I decided that they should be at the bottom of 
                the page because this is where the user will end up when they are done reading through the 
                information. This presented the problem of overflow. If I wanted to have the information in a 
                container large enough for the user to be comfortable reading, the buttons would be hidden 
                at the bottom of the page. To solve this, I increased their size and reduced the padding around 
                them so that they would be closer to where the user stops reading (Fitts’ Law). This way, the 
                buttons are visible, and the user will know that there’s more to the page if they scroll beyond 
                the container. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The nav bar is there for people who are looking for “quick info”. If you’re here to read my 
                blog posts or maybe to read about how I designed the web page, you probably clicked on the 
                site with the intention of sticking around for a bit. Now let’s say you clicked on the site 
                because you want to find my email address, or maybe my CV, or something like that. That kind 
                of information, that you would simply check and then leave the site, is what I call “quick info”. 
                This is what the buttons on the nav bar provide the user with.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My thoughts when I first heard about Tesla’s shenanigans, I believed that 
                they should be shut down. Never to operate again. I mean being dishonest 
                and killing people? That’s despicable. Then I thought about the thousands 
                and thousands of people employed by Tesla. Is taking down an entire company 
                of (probably) innocent people ethical? Then there’s the fact that Tesla 
                technically did tell people in their user manuals. Can we overrule the law 
                because people died? That’s quite a slippery slope and we’ll soon find 
                ourselves pushing the law aside whenever something bad happens. Now even as 
                someone trying to enforce ethical behaviours, you have to worry about doing 
                it ethically. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Now we get to the UI.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I have given all the clickable elements on the site a border effect for 
                when the user hovers over them. This just lets the user know that they can 
                indeed click on the element they are looking at.   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Since a large majority of the information given to the user is going to be 
                text based, I want them to be comfortable reading for a long time. This is the 
                reason for using relatively dull colours (black, white and grey). These colours 
                together are very easy on the eyes, just like a newspaper. I’ve never seen somebody 
                rub their eyes after reading one of those for a long time. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I have used a font from the Sans-Serif font family. Peta mentioned in her notes that 
                they are good for readability and after some investigation of my own, I found that 
                it was the best font family for an almost entirely text-based site. It has great 
                legibility and is very comfortable to read.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My website is not overly complicated and has very few UI/UX elements to speak about. 
                I believe that the few elements that are there, have come together to create an easy, 
                comfortable browsing and reading experience. It may not be visually spectacular, but 
                your eyes will thank you for that.
