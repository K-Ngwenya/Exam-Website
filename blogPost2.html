                Semantic Markup.
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Semantic Markup seems to have many definitions that somewhat agree with each other. 
                Most sources agree that it is a way of writing HTML that clearly defines the 
                different sections and the layout of your website for both the user and the browser.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Some examples of semantic elements in HTML are: &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;summary&gt;, 
                and &lt;header&gt;. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Semantic markup can help you get your information to your target audience. By placing 
                the right information in the right tags, you can establish a hierarchy that helps 
                browsers know what your page is about. Now your webpage can be ranked according to 
                its most important content and pulled up for relevant searches. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Webpages without semantic markup are basically inaccessible to people with disabilities 
                who would normally rely on assistive technologies to access information on the web. 
                A lack of semantic markup would also make your page inaccessible to people that use 
                text browsers, browsers without stylesheets, and other tools or devices that rely on 
                semantic markup. By using semantic markup, you make your information accessible to a 
                lot more people.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Developers also benefit from the use of semantic markup as it makes code easier to 
                maintain in the long run. If another developer was to take over your project or simply 
                read your code, they would find clear and well-structured code. This means no confusion, 
                and no train smash if you decide to go on holiday and your website has an issue in your 
                absence.
