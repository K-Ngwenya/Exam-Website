                Metadata.
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Metadata is data that provides information about other data. 
                It helps to describe, sort, and identify pieces of information. 
                For example, a book can have a title, an author, and a year 
                published. This information is metadata.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Metadata comes in a few different flavours. The main three are 
                Descriptive metadata, Administrative metadata, and Structural metadata.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Descriptive metadata helps us discover, identify, and select resources. 
                Examples of this include titles, authors, keywords, and dates. This 
                is the simplest and most utilized form of metadata. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Administrative metadata is all about control and preservation. It tells us 
                what types of instructions, rules, and restrictions are placed on a file. 
                This type of information is used to manage access to the information. 
                Examples of this are copyright information, owner and licensing information, 
                and preservation activities.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Structural metadata is all about organization and, well, structure. It 
                describes how components of data are organized and put together with other 
                data. Examples of this are page numbers, sections, chapters, indexes, and Tables of Content. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The purpose of metadata is to make finding the right information easier 
                for the user and even though this sounds like an optional luxury, it is 
                extremely important. Let’s try to imagine a world without metadata: 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Let’s imagine a library. Not an infinite one, just your regular public 
                library. Your average public library can easily have over a thousand 
                books. Now let’s remove all the covers, titles, bar codes, and blurbs from 
                those books. Now if you wanted to find, say, a book on dentistry it would 
                be extremely difficult. You would have to look inside every single book 
                to figure out if it’s the book you want. You could get lucky and find it 
                on the first, second, or third try but what if you don’t? What if you start 
                on the opposite side of the library and the book you want is 350 books away? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Now imagine the same scenario in the context of the world wide web. Millions 
                of articles, web pages, videos, and documents but no metadata. It would all 
                be useless because you’d need to perform a ritual and sacrifice a goat every 
                time you want to find something. So, unless you’re a wizard, you need metadata.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Metadata makes it possible for the user to find exactly what they are looking 
                for quickly and efficiently. It also makes it possible for people who provide 
                information to organise their work.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The preservation of knowledge also depends on metadata. Storing thousands of 
                GB of data is great but how do we get pieces of it back out if we don’t know
                where those pieces are?
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The MEMEX, as proposed by Vannevar Bush in 1945, would allow people to store 
                and recall information with great speed and flexibility. Even this device would 
                almost entirely on the use of metadata to organize, store, and recall data.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Metadata allows is useful in this way because it allows us to organize information 
                based on certain pieces of data. Articles can be grouped together by author or year 
                published. Web pages can appear together in a search because they have the same/similar 
                titles. Information on 100 different topics can be found, neatly stored in a single 
                1000-page encyclopedia.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Without it, information is a waste of time and space. Through doing research, I have 
                developed a new sense of appreciation for Metadata. I may not have known about it a 
                week ago, but now I know that I would not be able to live without it.
