            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The image you see below is the style guide for this website. 
                It contains all the colours, colour codes, and fonts used on 
                the site. All of these things were chosen and implemented with
                the goal of creating a simple, clean looking website. 
            </p>
            <img src="Style Guide.jpg" alt="Definitly a style guide.">
            <p class="paragraph">
                I have used the colours black, white, and grey for the entire 
                site. This colour scheme required very little thought and 
                effort to implement. It also means that my text is easy to 
                read (white text on a black background). 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The grey is used as a background colour for the &lt;main&gt; sections 
                    of the page, just so it isn’t too bright. I sometimes have 
                    trouble doing readings and looking at web pages when they’re 
                    mostly white, so this one is for people have the same/similar issues. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                All the colours together give the website a newspaper like look which 
                was an unintended but welcome side effect of my colour scheme.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The fonts are still the same as in the previous iteration. Helvetica 
                from the Ariel family. This is because it is just so easy on the eye.
