                Information Geographies
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                “Toward a study of information geographies” (hereinafter called TSG) aims 
                to be the start of a conversation on information geographies. It does so 
                by exploring three types of information geographies: access, participation, 
                and representation. In its exploration of these geographies, it provides 
                statistical information as well as a few thoughts and insights on these statistics. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Pre-digital information geographies
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Starting with the pre-digital age, TSG highlights reasons why it was challenging to 
                properly distribute and contribute to information in the pre-digital age. Most of 
                the points made may lead you to believe that a large percentage of information that 
                was created in this age was created and stored in places where funds and the necessary 
                skills are readily available. Places like the global North. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The only point in this section of TSG that was questionable was the beginning of the 
                third paragraph on page 90. It reads “Books, newspapers, and patents, for instance, 
                were all far more likely to be published from (and about) the global North: with the 
                global South playing a relatively minor role in producing, using, and controlling 
                codified information”. The mention of newspapers makes little sense in a discussion 
                about global accessibility of information. I, for one, have never even seen an 
                American newspaper. Newspapers are usually (if not always) a means of distributing 
                local information locally. Even if there is information in the global North that I 
                want to access, it doesn’t make sense for me to get it via one of their newspapers. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I believe that information being geographically embedded may be because of the different 
                rates at which the global North and global South developed. One of the reasons cited in 
                TSG for information being difficult to access/contribute to  that information became 
                concentrated at universities or associations that had the funds to collect and process 
                this information. Well, the first university in Europe was founded in 1088 whilst the 
                first one in Africa only became recognized as a university in 1916. This is an important 
                thing to note because by the time the global South had begun trying to gather information, 
                the global North already had it. I imagine hearing that somebody else has already discovered 
                something would discourage a people from noting their own discoveries on the topic. Plus, 
                why make the effort and spend the resources to build up your own stores of knowledge when the 
                knowledge exists just a boat away. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                The geographies
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In exploring the various categories of internet geographies, the text gives statistics, 
                suggests what the driving forces behind these statistics may be, and asks some questions 
                related to these issues. That is fine, but I want to try and ponder some solutions to these 
                problems as I believe that if all we do is ponder problems, we’re training to be intellectuals 
                and not problem solvers. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Geographies of access and enablement
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This category focuses on who has access to the technologies, services, and resources necessary 
                to access and contribute to the global pool of information. The first statistic we are given is 
                internet penetration by country. Internet penetration is defined as the relationship between the 
                number of internet users in each country and its demographic data. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Countries in the global South (except for Qatar) are shown to have the lowest internet penetrations. 
                This is not surprising because the global South includes some of the poorest nations in the world. 
                Access to the internet requires a good deal of infrastructure and financial investment from the user.  
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                TSG mentions that the cost of an internet connection is higher in the global South. According to the 
                graphs given, the problem is a lot worse in Africa than in South America and the rest of the global 
                South, so let us focus on Africa. This perspective is good for statistics but not great for understanding. 
                It is a lot easier to understand what is happening when you think of it like this: people in the Africa 
                simply earn less. In these countries, unemployment rates are generally high and those who do have jobs work 
                relatively low paying jobs.  
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                There are a lot of reasons for this. Some countries are gripped by civil war and/or violent dictatorships. 
                Others are held back by extreme corruption within their governments. Africa is behind the rest of the world 
                in many aspects and will stay that way until we get better leadership. This continent boasts (maybe not “boast”) 
                the highest number of people living in extreme poverty. The only way to increase internet penetration in this 
                case would be to decrease the poverty. Feed the people, give them jobs, give them safety. Only then should 
                luxuries (and I say luxuries because you the internet should be exceptionally low on the people’s list of needs) 
                be provided.   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                One may argue that introducing the internet and giving the people better access to information is a way to 
                alleviate some of the poverty. One is wrong. The internet in this case simply opens another way for the 
                same shenanigans to continue. According to an article by Gorden Corera in 2020, ISIS has been found to be 
                committing acts of terror via Facebook. So, before we think about ways to get Africa and other struggling 
                countries better access to the internet and the information it holds, we should really solve the much 
                bigger problems these countries are currently facing.  
            </p>
            <h3>
                Geographies of participation
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This focuses on where the information on the internet is coming from. The first statistic we are given is 
                that of domain names per country. A domain name is defined as a unique, address used to access websites. 
                So, this information shows us how many websites are being created in each country.   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Here we see that, unsurprisingly, a lot of the information we enjoy on the internet comes from the global 
                North. Now the most important driving factor for these stats is not population or even something financial. 
                These stats are mostly influenced by the amount of freedom that the people in that country enjoy. People in 
                countries like the USA have the freedom to say whatever they feel like. Even if someone does say something 
                the government does not like, the repercussions are usually minor, so people are likely to take the gamble. 
                In countries where information is heavily censored, people who break these censorship laws usually go missing.   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This means we should not be surprised when countries like North Korea, China, Iran, and Belarus are sporting 
                low participation numbers. The people are not encouraged to share their opinions if those opinions do not suit 
                the governments agendas.   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Another participation indicator we get is GitHub users and/or commits per country. GitHub is a code hosting 
                platform for version control and collaboration. Looking at the number of commits can be an indicator of how 
                much software is coming out of each country. I believe these numbers may point to a relationship between 
                participation and GDP. Wealthier countries contribute more software. This could be because wealthier 
                countries have better standards of living and therefore allow the people to explore new ways to make a 
                living. It could also be because a larger, functioning software sector contributes to the country's GDP. 
                I noticed this when I decided to investigate Singapore. Singapore is a global South country, but its number 
                of commits is quite close to that of countries like Australia. I then discovered that even though Singapore 
                is considered a global south country (where global South countries are defined as low-income, undeveloped 
                countries), its GDP is higher than that of Australia and New Zealand combined. COMBINED. Now there must be a 
                good reason for Singapore to be on the global South list. It probably lacks a few of the things that it needs 
                to be considered a developed country. That is why I believe GDP and participation are related.    
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Wikipedia related stats only use the English version of the platform. This leaves out a substantial portion 
                of people and will give us numbers that are skewed towards the global North. Using statistics that leave out a 
                substantial portion of the thing being investigated does not make sense and I believe those stats should have 
                been excluded from the article   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                For the problem of participation, education is the answer. Even in countries with strict censorship laws, if 
                you teach a people that they can prosper and grow through internet related activities they will be excited 
                and willing to contribute. People can start online businesses and YouTube channels (YouTube is also an 
                interesting sight to look at for participation, but unfortunately it is difficult to find upload stats.).    
            </p>
            <h3>
                Geographies of representation
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Here we focus on who information is created for. For this TSG starts with the number of Google search results 
                for country names. This statistic may not be indicative of who information is created for as technically 
                anybody from any country and search for another country. It may even be skewed be certain factors. For example, 
                the countries with the highest expenditure on travelling/tourism are all global North countries. These are 
                also the nations who make up most internet users in the world. If they all decided that Somalia is the hottest 
                place to holiday, Google would report many searches related to Botswana. Now our data shows that a sizeable 
                portion of information is made for the people of Botswana.    
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                OpenStreetMap contributions is a lot better for getting insight on who information is created for. Though 
                people may want to map countries they do not live in, it is most probably quite difficult for them to do so. 
                Therefore, I am happy to assume that contributions from a certain country come from somebody living in that 
                country. Looking at the data given in Figure 9 with this assumption in mind, we see that a vast majority of 
                the mapping done is done for global North countries. If similar numbers can be seen in other types of 
                information, then this means that for the countries that are not represented, majority of the information 
                they have access to is not for them. This may not seem like much of a problem at first glance but imagine 
                someone from South America trying to find out how to get into real-estate. The steps or “tips-and-tricks” 
                they find may only be effective with American real-estate laws and processes. Now all the information that 
                person has spent time gathering becomes useless. It may also discourage a people from learning and being 
                active on the web if the information they find on the internet is in a language or dialect they do not understand,
                or if the information simply cannot be applied in their specific region. This would feed into the low 
                participation numbers in the global South and maybe even turn into as an access issue. Other geographical 
                statistics would give the same insight as the OpenStreetMap numbers.    
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The problem of insufficient representation in the global South can be solved by solving the access and enablement 
                problem. From there, people would become aware of how and where they can contribute to information for/about their region.   
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                “Towards a study of internet geographies” does a fantastic job of introducing the reader to the problems with internet 
                geographies and the possible drivers behind them. It makes sense to want to help people understand the problem as you 
                cannot solve a problem that you do not understand. Some of the statistics used do feel a little bit forced, as if they 
                were chosen simply because they show a significant difference between the global North and the global South even though 
                the numbers do contribute to the point being made in a particular section. Other than that, the stats and their 
                accompanying graphs really hammer home the separate ways people experience information in their respective regions. 
                It may be difficult for us as future information providers (creators?) to solve these problems as a lot of them stem 
                from broader issues like economic and political difficulties. However, if there are solutions that work despite these 
                difficulties then they are 100% worth looking into because greater equality in access to information for all could change 
                the world.
