                Ethical Dilemmas of Software Engineering
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Codes of ethics, in all areas, are supposed to be a rigid 
                set of principles that govern how we behave. However, this 
                is almost never the case. Ethics have become more like guidelines. 
                Especially in the world of software. Software engineering as a 
                field of research and a career is still relatively young. Because of
                this, it seems like we never know what to do when people start to 
                do dodgy things. So we just kind of stand on the side-lines, asking 
                ‘difficult’ questions and being okay when nothing comes of it.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I believe that these dilemmas should not even be dilemmas. If Boeng 
                engineers implement a quick fix to an issue they created and it kills 
                hundreds of people, there should be massive ramifications for that. 
                When Tesla misinforms people about the capabilities of their vehicles
                and it gets people killed, there should be massive ramifications for 
                that. Instead, these things are let off with slap on the wrist. We 
                are okay with these things because when they come out, because the 
                companies scramble and panic to rectify the issue. I believe watching 
                them squirm like this gives us enough satisfaction to forget about the 
                issue because we forget that they’re freaking out to save their income 
                stream and not because they know they’re wrong. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Let’s look at the Tesla incidents for a minute. Tesla was not upfront 
                about the actual capabilities of their vehicles. This wouldn’t be the 
                first time this occurred in advertising. The real problem here is that 
                people died as a result. So how do we punish this? Apparently, it is 
                stated in the manuals that the cars require constant supervision. It 
                may be hidden behind a few pages of the manual, but it’s there. Is it 
                unethical not to be upfront about such important details or is the consumer 
                responsible for reading and understanding the entire user manual? Where 
                is the line between consumer responsibility and company ethics? 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This is what makes ethical discussions so difficult. Even though there 
                should be a solid black line between right and wrong, there are just so 
                many perspectives and variables that turn a simple line into a labyrinth. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My thoughts when I first heard about Tesla’s shenanigans, I believed that 
                they should be shut down. Never to operate again. I mean being dishonest 
                and killing people? That’s despicable. Then I thought about the thousands 
                and thousands of people employed by Tesla. Is taking down an entire company 
                of (probably) innocent people ethical? Then there’s the fact that Tesla 
                technically did tell people in their user manuals. Can we overrule the law 
                because people died? That’s quite a slippery slope and we’ll soon find 
                ourselves pushing the law aside whenever something bad happens. Now even as 
                someone trying to enforce ethical behaviours, you have to worry about doing 
                it ethically. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Topics like ethics make me cringe. I really don’t like them. They just never 
                seem to have an actual solution. A conversation on ethics ends when everybody 
                involved decided they can’t/won’t participate anymore. Not because we’ve all 
                come to an understanding. It almost feels pointless to discuss.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I understand why discussing it is important though. Things aren’t great right 
                now, but without the people asking these tough questions and having these 
                discussions, things could be a hell of a lot worse.  
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I don’t even know if the first half of this blog post made any sense. I was 
                (and still am) trying to think of this from a million different perspectives 
                at once and it is frying my brain. This is where I give up.
