            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My first website had the goal of being very simple, with 
                minimal navigation methods and a colour scheme that was 
                both clean and easy on the eye.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This site has similar goals, but with the BMW website as 
                inspiration. My goal is still to keep the number of different 
                navigation methods to a minimum. I have decided to have my 
                navigation bar on the top of the page like normal websites. 
                This is not only something that is familiar to most experienced 
                web surfers, but it also gives me more screen space to work with 
                and makes the technical work a little easier. Side navigation bars 
                can be finicky when you’re tackling them for the first time. This 
                decision was also inspired by the BMW website, which has a navigation 
                bar on the top of the screen. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I also decided to have my home page dedicated to navigation. It should 
                act as a sort of “hub” where the user can go to find a path to 
                everything on the site in once place. This decision came with a problem. 
                I want to have a clean, neat sight, but if I’m going to have everything 
                on one page it might mess up that vision. My solution to this problem came 
                to me when I was on the BMW website, browsing and looking at options for 
                cars I can’t afford, and I noticed that their “Build & Price” pages hold a 
                lot of different options and information without overloading the page. This 
                is because some of the options they want you to chose from are hidden and 
                scrollable, so the user only sees about 2 or 3 at a time. This is where I got 
                the idea for “scrollable buttons” (I’m not sure what to call that section 
                where you can scroll through a horizontal set of buttons) came from. The user 
                can find and choose which ever piece of information they want without being 
                overwhelmed by all the buttons and links on their screen. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The home page is separated into 3 groups of buttons (separated by headings): 
                Blog Posts, Design Journey, and About me. I just thought it would be a nice, 
                neat way to divide the information up. This is necessary because if I have 
                millions of items you can scroll through, it will become extremely difficult 
                for anybody to find anything. Right now, there are a maximum of 6 buttons in 
                each section and I believe I can go up to 10 before the system will need to 
                be changed. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Now you might be thinking “If these scrollable buttons exist, what’s the point 
                of the nav bar?”. Good question. The nav bar is there for people who are looking 
                for “quick info”. If you’re here to read my blog posts or maybe to read about 
                how I designed the web page, you probably clicked on the site with the intention 
                of sticking around for a bit. Now let’s say you clicked on the site because you 
                want to find my email address, or maybe my CV, or something like that. That kind 
                of information, that you would simply check and then leave the site, is what I call 
                “quick info”. This is what the buttons on the nav bar provide the user with. An 
                easy way to access information without having to liaise with my navigation system. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                If you’re here for the juicy stuff, however, you’ll find that each page has a replica 
                of the scrollable button system at the bottom. This is so that the user can quickly 
                and easily switch between pieces of information under the same category as the one 
                they are currently reading. This way, they don’t have to return to the home page to 
                navigate unless they want to enter a different category of information. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The feedback from my previous submission mentioned something about my paragraphs starting 
                and ending too close to the page. This made the text on the website difficult or awkward 
                to read. To fix this, I put the text in a box and justified it. Now the text is at least 
                70mm (I measured) from the ends of the screen. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I used the same Helvetica font from the previous submission because it is simple and easy to read. 
            </p>

                Thank you for reading. There is no conclusion paragraph. Just stop reading right…about…here.
